Great question! Understanding **how user requests enter a Kubernetes system** and **how they flow through microservices** is key to grasping the architecture.

Let me explain in two parts:

---

## üß≠ PART 1: **How to Find "How the User Request Comes In"**

### üîç A. Identify the **Entry Point**

1. **Check for Ingress Controllers**
   These are commonly used to expose services to the outside world.

   ```bash
   kubectl get ingress -A
   ```

2. **Check for LoadBalancer or NodePort Services**
   If no Ingress, apps may be exposed via services.

   ```bash
   kubectl get svc -A
   ```

   Look for:

   * `TYPE=LoadBalancer`: Exposed externally via cloud LB (e.g., AWS ELB)
   * `TYPE=NodePort`: Exposed on a port of the Kubernetes node

3. **Check DNS or Domain Names (if used)**
   Domains like `app.mycompany.com` are usually mapped to the LoadBalancer IP or Ingress.

---

### üß™ B. Test the Flow

Let‚Äôs say you find an **Ingress** like this:

```bash
kubectl get ingress -n my-namespace
```

It might show:

```
NAME         HOSTS              SERVICE         PORTS
web-ingress  app.mycompany.com web-service     80
```

Then:

* The **user sends a request** to `app.mycompany.com`
* DNS maps to Ingress Controller (like NGINX or ALB)
* Ingress forwards the request to `web-service`
* `web-service` forwards it to the matching **Pod** (container)

---

## üß± PART 2: **How Microservices Work in Kubernetes**

In a **microservices-based app**, the request usually flows like this:

```
User ‚Üí Ingress ‚Üí Service A (Frontend)
                    ‚Üì
              Service B (Auth)
                    ‚Üì
              Service C (DB/API)
```

### üìå What to Look for:

* **Multiple Deployments/Pods** for different services

  ```bash
  kubectl get deployments -A
  ```

* **Inter-service Communication** via internal DNS:

  * Example: `http://auth-service.default.svc.cluster.local`

* Services may call each other using:

  * REST (HTTP APIs)
  * gRPC
  * Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

## üîç How to Identify Which Is Microservices App

### ‚úÖ Signs It's a Microservices App:

| Clue                                                                       | Command                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Many small deployments/pods with different purposes                        | `kubectl get deployments -A`         |
| Each service has its own Docker image                                      | `kubectl describe deployment <name>` |
| Services communicate via internal DNS or APIs                              | Check logs or environment variables  |
| Service-to-service calls (from logs)                                       | `kubectl logs <pod-name>`            |
| Microservice names like `user-service`, `order-service`, `payment-service` | Check pod names                      |

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step: Trace a Real Request

Let‚Äôs say a user opens a shopping website:

1. **User accesses** `https://shop.example.com`

2. Goes to **Ingress Controller**

   ```bash
   kubectl get ingress -A
   ```

3. Ingress forwards to frontend service:

   ```bash
   frontend ‚Üí calls product-service ‚Üí calls inventory-service ‚Üí calls DB
   ```

4. View this flow via:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs <frontend-pod>
   ```

   Look for logs like:

   ```
   GET /api/products ‚Üí called product-service
   ```

5. View internal service call:

   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <frontend-pod> -- curl http://product-service:8080/api/list
   ```

## ‚úÖ Summary

To **find how the request comes in** and **how microservices communicate**:

| Task                 | Command                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Find Ingress or LB   | `kubectl get ingress -A`, `kubectl get svc -A` |
| List deployments     | `kubectl get deployments -A`                   |
| View logs            | `kubectl logs <pod-name>`                      |
| Trace internal calls | `kubectl exec <pod> -- curl <service>:<port>`  |
| Export architecture  | `kubectl get all -o yaml -n <namespace>`       |
